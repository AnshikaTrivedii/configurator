# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Quotations Not Showing in Dashboard

## Problem Summary

**Reported Issue:** Sales persons were creating and saving quotations, but these quotations were **not appearing in the Super User Dashboard**.

## Root Cause

The quotations **WERE being saved** to the database successfully. However, the Super User Dashboard was filtering them out based on their status.

The dashboard was **only counting quotations** with these statuses:
- ✓ `'Converted'`
- ✓ `'In Progress'`
- ✓ `'pending'`

It was **excluding** quotations with these statuses:
- ✗ `'New'` ← Most quotations have this status!
- ✗ `'Rejected'`
- ✗ `'Hold'`

## Impact Analysis

### Before the Fix:
- **3 out of 14 quotations** were visible (21%)
- **11 quotations were hidden** (79%)
- Sales persons couldn't see most of their quotations
- Dashboard showed incorrect statistics

### Status Breakdown:
```
Status          Count    Old Behavior
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
New               9     ✗ Hidden
Rejected          2     ✗ Hidden
Converted         1     ✓ Visible
pending           1     ✓ Visible
In Progress       1     ✓ Visible
```

### After the Fix:
- **14 out of 14 quotations** are visible (100%)
- **367% increase** in visible quotations
- All sales persons can see their complete quotation history
- Dashboard shows accurate statistics

## Solution Implemented

### File Modified: `/backend/routes/sales.js`

#### Change 1: Removed status filter from quotation counting (Lines 396-402)
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const quotationCount = await Quotation.countDocuments({
  salesUserId: user._id,
  status: { $in: ['Converted', 'In Progress', 'pending'] },
  ...dateFilter
});

// AFTER:
const quotationCount = await Quotation.countDocuments({
  salesUserId: user._id,
  ...dateFilter
});
```

#### Change 2: Removed status filter from revenue calculation (Lines 404-418)

#### Change 3: Removed status filter from statistics aggregation (Lines 442-470)

## Verification

Run this command to verify the fix:
```bash
