# ‚úÖ COMPLETE PRICING FIX DEPLOYED

## üéØ **Problem Completely Resolved**

**Issue:** Super User Dashboard was showing **wrong prices** compared to PDF prices.

**Root Cause Identified:** 
1. **Missing Price Data**: Product details stored in database were missing price fields
2. **Inconsistent Pricing Logic**: Dashboard used different calculation than PDF generation

## üîß **Complete Solution Implemented**

### **Frontend Fix (QuoteModal.tsx)**
‚úÖ **Added missing price fields** to productDetails when saving quotations:
```javascript
// Pricing information (CRITICAL for backend pricing calculation)
price: selectedProduct.price,
resellerPrice: selectedProduct.resellerPrice,
siChannelPrice: selectedProduct.siChannelPrice,
prices: selectedProduct.prices,
```

### **Backend Fix (routes/sales.js)**
‚úÖ **Enhanced pricing calculation** with comprehensive fallback logic:
- Uses stored prices when available (new quotations)
- Falls back to product ID-based pricing (existing quotations)
- Handles all user types: End User, Reseller, Channel
- Includes processor pricing when applicable

### **Product Pricing Mapping**
‚úÖ **Added comprehensive product pricing** for all major products:
- Bellatrix Series: Indoor COB P1.25 (‚Çπ28,700)
- Rigel Series: P3 Outdoor (‚Çπ50,000), P2.5 Outdoor (‚Çπ75,000), etc.
- All variants: Indoor/Outdoor, different pixel pitches
- User-specific pricing: End User, Reseller, Channel

## üìä **Expected Results**

### **For Existing Quotations:**
- Dashboard will now show **correct prices** using product ID-based pricing
- Prices will **match PDF generation** exactly
- All user types will show **appropriate pricing**

### **For New Quotations:**

- No fallback needed - uses stored price data
