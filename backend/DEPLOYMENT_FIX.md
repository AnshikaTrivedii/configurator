# Super Admin Login Issue - Deployment Fix

## Problem Identified
The Super Admin login works locally but fails in production with "Invalid email or password" error. This is caused by missing or incorrect environment variables in the Railway deployment.

## Root Cause
The production deployment doesn't have the correct environment variables configured, specifically:
1. `JWT_SECRET` - Different from local environment
2. `MONGODB_URI` - May be pointing to wrong database
3. `NODE_ENV` - Should be set to 'production'

## Solution Steps

### 1. Configure Railway Environment Variables

Go to your Railway project dashboard and add these environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://trivedianshika48_db_user:pPMA2M5qLhIbh58y@cluster0.kssxg5e.mongodb.net/configurator?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-for-production-only-change-this-to-something-very-secure
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key-here
```

### 2. Verify Database Connection

The Super Admin user exists in the database with these credentials:
- Email: `super@orion-led.com`
- Password: `Orion@123`
- Role: `super`

### 3. Test the Fix

After setting the environment variables:
1. Redeploy your Railway application
2. Test the Super Admin login with the credentials above
3. Verify that the dashboard loads correctly

### 4. Frontend Configuration

Make sure your frontend is configured to use the correct production API URL:
- Set `VITE_API_URL` to your Railway backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.railway.app/api`)

## Verification Scripts

I've created these scripts to help debug the issue:

1. `debug-production-login-env.cjs` - Checks database connection and user existence
2. `test-production-login.cjs` - Simulates the complete login process

Run these locally to verify the database and authentication logic work correctly.

## Important Notes

1. **JWT Secret**: Make sure the JWT_SECRET in production is the same as what you're using locally, or update your local environment to match production.

2. **Database**: The production database connection string should point to the same database where the Super Admin user exists.

3. **CORS**: The backend is configured to accept requests from the FRONTEND_URL environment variable.

4. **Password Hashing**: The bcrypt implementation is consistent between local and production environments.

## Next Steps

1. Set the environment variables in Railway
2. Redeploy the application
3. Test the Super Admin login
4. If issues persist, check the Railway logs for any error messages
