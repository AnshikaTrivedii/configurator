# Super User Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ **Issue Fixed: Super User Login**

The Super User login issue has been resolved! The password hash in the database has been updated and the authentication is now working correctly.

## 🔑 **Super User Credentials**
- **Email**: `super@orion-led.com`
- **Password**: `Orion@123`
- **Role**: `super`

## 🎯 **How to Access the Super User Dashboard**

1. **Login as Super User**:
   - Click the "🔐 SALES LOGIN" button in the top-right corner
   - Enter the credentials above
   - Click "Login"

2. **Access Dashboard**:
   - After successful login, you should see a purple "Dashboard" button in the top-right corner
   - Click the "Dashboard" button to access the Super User dashboard
   - The dashboard will show all sales users, their quotation counts, and statistics

## 🔍 **If You Still Don't See the Dashboard**

### **Step 1: Check Your Login Status**
- Make sure you're logged in as the Super User (not a regular sales user)
- You should see "Super User" in the top-right corner next to the Dashboard button
- If you see a different name, you're logged in as a regular sales user

### **Step 2: Check Browser Console**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Look for any JavaScript errors
4. Check for these debug messages:
   ```
   🎯 App.tsx - handleSalesLogin - user: [user object]
   🎯 App.tsx - user.role: super
   🎯 App.tsx - setting userRole to: super
   🎯 DisplayConfigurator - userRole: super
   🎯 DisplayConfigurator - showDashboard: false
   ```

### **Step 3: Verify Environment Variables (Production)**
If you're testing in production, make sure these environment variables are set in Railway:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://trivedianshika48_db_user:pPMA2M5qLhIbh58y@cluster0.kssxg5e.mongodb.net/configurator?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-for-production-only-change-this-to-something-very-secure
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### **Step 4: Test the API Directly**
Run this command to test your production API:
```bash
node test-production-api.cjs https://your-backend.railway.app
```

## 🧪 **Testing Scripts Available**

1. **Test Super User Login**: `node -r dotenv/config test-super-user-login.cjs`
2. **Fix Super User**: `node -r dotenv/config fix-production-super-user.cjs`
3. **Verify Environment**: `node verify-production-env.cjs`
4. **Test Production API**: `node test-production-api.cjs <RAILWAY_URL>`

## 🎨 **Dashboard Features**

Once you access the Super User dashboard, you'll see:
- **Sales Users List**: All sales users with their details
- **Quotation Statistics**: Total quotations, active users, top performers
- **Revenue Tracking**: Total revenue and monthly breakdowns
- **User Management**: Click on any sales user to see their detailed quotations
- **Filtering Options**: Filter by date range and location

## 🚨 **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue**: "Invalid email or password"
**Solution**: The password has been fixed. Use the credentials above.

### **Issue**: Dashboard button not visible
**Solution**: Make sure you're logged in as Super User (role: super), not as a regular sales user.

### **Issue**: Dashboard loads but shows no data
**Solution**: Check if there are sales users in the database. The dashboard shows data from the `salesusers` collection.

### **Issue**: CORS errors in browser console
**Solution**: Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable is set correctly in production.

## 📞 **Still Having Issues?**

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Check the browser console** for any error messages
2. **Verify you're using the correct credentials**: `super@orion-led.com` / `Orion@123`
3. **Make sure you're testing on the correct environment** (local vs production)
4. **Run the test scripts** to verify the backend is working correctly

The Super User dashboard should now be fully functional! 🎉
