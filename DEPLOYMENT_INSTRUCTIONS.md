2. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Go to your Railway dashboard: https://railway.app

   - Watch the "Deployments" tab for the new deployment

## ⏰ Wait Time

**Please wait 3-5 minutes** for Railway to:

## 🧪 How to Verify the Fix (After 5 minutes)

```

### Step 2: Test the Dashboard

2. Login as Super User:
   - Email: `super@orion-led.com`
